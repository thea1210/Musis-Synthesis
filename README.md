# Musis-Synthesis

This repository showcases a MATLAB implementation of the musical synthesis of "Onegai" from Kamisama Kiss, the final output for CEDISP1. The project consists of a single composition with multiple tracks, where each track represents an instrument or utilizes DSP effects. Each track employs a unique digital signal processing (DSP) technique, such as synthesis or effects, ensuring that each contributes at least 20 seconds of sound. The project incorporates key DSP concepts, including synthesis and filtering, and demonstrates advanced techniques like ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release). The DSP techniques used for each track are documented, highlighting the learning and application of these methods throughout the composition.

To run the program:
- Install the Needed Libraries
- Run main.m in Matlab
